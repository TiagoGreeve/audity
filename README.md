# Audity
The goal of this project is to create a audio player for local files. Say no to enslavement by subscription. More and more artists are selling their work digitally. 
Another idea of mine is to make some sort of marketplace to buy and sell these music files.

## Functionality
Scans certain folders for music and makes them playable. There is one list for singles and one list for albums, albums can be created from the app.
